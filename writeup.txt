WRITEUP
    Our dataset was the CIA Factbook, which includes global data on health, economy, energy,
and other features. Because the data was, at its core, geographic in the sense that each
country had its own values for each of the data categories. Thus, we knew from the beginning
that our visualization would have some kind of map component to it. From there, we had
to wrestle with the sheer number of features that the data contained. It quickly became
overwhelming to try and incorporate all of the data attributes into the visualization in a way
that made sense and was easy to follow - so we made a decision to only focus on a subset of the
attributes that we felt showed interesting insights into the data and allowed viewers to perform
exploratory analysis without needing too much outside context.
    We then focused on the actual method of interaction that we wanted to utilize for our
visualization. We knew that one of the main ways that users would use the data would be to compare
different countries. The comparison was more noteworthy than the actual raw numbers for population,
GDP, etc. and this is also the way the underlying data was structured: each attribute had a list
of countries ranked and sorted by their corresponding values. So we knew that we wanted a comparison
feature in our design. To this end, we created a table that allowed users to compare values for two
countries. We then realized that this was too contraining - it did not allow users to see the overall
ranking for all the countries. To solve this problem, we created sliders that filtered based on range.
This allows users to see which countries are ranked highest and which are ranked lowest for the features
we chose.
